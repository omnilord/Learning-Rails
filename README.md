Welcome to the Stock tracking app as defined by '''The Complete Ruby on Rails developer Course'''
available at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course).

This app supports using a gem to discover stock prices electronically in as near to real-time
as is allowed by law, uses the Devise gem for user management, and performs several other
features that may or may not actually be useful in a real application (you probably wouldn't
want to follow your friends stocks, since that has some questionable legality).

Please enjoy my code while I learn more about Ruby on Rails.  Thanks for reviewing!
