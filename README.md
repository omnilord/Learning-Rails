# Eric L. Truitte Learns Ruby on Rails!

Course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/
Cert of completion: TBA

Welcome to my repository to demonstrating what I've learned about working with Rails.


The blog branch is the first application "Alpha Blog" that is used to introduce students
to Ruby on Rails.  Unlike the lessons, I use PostgreSQL in both development and production.
The reason for this is, I adapted my implemention to take advantage of certain PostgreSQL
features (arrays, JSON, etc.) that I enjoy working with.
