This repository is a just a working set from learning Ruby on Rail through the *The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course* located on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/).  Unlike a usual Gitflow repository, each branch herein is setup to contain a different project from the course to minimize my github repository count.  I chose to do it this way so-as-to not have a bunch of messy nested projects, and to make it easier to identify which project I was working on from the file system.

At Present, I have two functional applications from the course checked into Github:

- [Blogs app](https://github.com/omnilord/Learning-Rails/tree/blog)
- [Stocks app](https://github.com/omnilord/Learning-Rails/tree/stocks)
- [Photos app](https://github.com/omnilord/learning-rails/tree/photos)

The descriptions of each of these project apps can be view on the respective branch in the README.md file.
